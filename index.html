            <p>Iâ€™ve always loved the old-school feel of 8-bit graphics. One of the very first games I played was Super Mario Brothers and I fell in love. Another love of mine is sarcasm and parody, so naturally when Futurama did a short segment of their show in glorious 8-bit I was obsessed. It was this obsession that led me to create a simple game in that style.I hope you enjoy it!</p>
